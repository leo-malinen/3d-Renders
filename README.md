# 3D Still Renders

## Overview

These 3D renders, all created and rendered using Blender, are designed as non animated, standalone images, each representing in their cases a unique scene. The renders are not part of a continuous animation like some of my others you may see in this portfolio but rather individual snapshots that show their own views. Each image or group of images is prefixed with a specific letter that marks the underlying theme which will be listed below and sets the different tone for each of the images altogether. 

## What each image folder has
Landscapes are what they say they are and are still image renders of scenery or just nature in general, whereas points of interest are more infrastructure and man made objects and such.

# 3D Renders (Still images)

## Overview

These 3D renders, all created and rendered using Blender, are designed as non animated, standalone images, each representing in their cases a unique scene. The renders are not part of a continuous animation like some of my others you may see in this portfolio but rather individual snapshots that show their own views. Each image or group of images is prefixed with a specific letter that marks the underlying theme which will be listed below and sets the different tone for each of the images altogether. 

## What each image prefix means
The S will be denoted as the scenery, and the P will be point of interest
